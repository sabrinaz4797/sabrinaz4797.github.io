<h2>SUSHI HEAVEN</h2>
<h3>POSTED BY YAMA-ADMIN ON AUGUST 28, 2015 WITH 0 COMMENT</h3>

  One of the best parts about getting married at Yamashiro, besides the stunning LA views and intimate garden ceremonies, is that you can treat your guests to a culinary experience they'll be talking about for years. These are the most important people in your life – why not give them the best?
<BR>
  <br>
In addition to hand-passed hors d'oeuvres and delicious entrees, one wedding option is this impressive sushi display. Made of yellowtail, tuna, shrimp, salmon, california rolls and more, this display might get more attention than the flowers – but you won't even mind.
